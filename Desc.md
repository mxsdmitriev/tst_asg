Plans provide product clients with a variety of service options defined within a preconfigured score.

Please note that your customer service flow and solutions may change after the incoming update. User records will be supplemented with additional properties according to 
the latest version of our API reference. For example: users can be transferred to the 'signing' state before they confirm their purchase.

The capacity of plans per provider is limited by userâ€™s types. Despite that, plans are just user attributes and the corresponding state.
