# Task 3

Plans provide product clients with a pre-configured variety of service options.

> **Note**
> 
> Please note that customer service flow may change after the incoming update. User records will have additional properties according to 
the latest version of our API reference. For example: users can be transferred to the `signing` state before they confirm their purchase. Some of the guidelines and instructions may require an update.

The capacity of plans per provider is limited by user account types available (except `guest` and `admin` types).
